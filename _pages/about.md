<p>I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. <a href="http://mm.kaist.ac.kr/joon/" target="_blank">Joon Son Chung</a> at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">KAIST</a>. 
I earned my M.S. supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XA8EOlEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">In So Kweon</a> at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">KAIST</a>. I was a visiting student at <a href="https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/" target="_blank">VGG Group</a>, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Oxford</a>, under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UZ5wscMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Andrew Zisserman</a>. </p>

<p>My research focuses on data-hungry problems (e.g., semi-supervised learning) and bias in data labels (e.g., class-imbalance) for deep neural networks. 
I also have a broad interest in learning general representations (e.g., self-supervised learning) and improving model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g., domain generalization).</p>

  My research aims to effectively train deep neural networks with multi-modality (vision, audio and text). Also, I have an interest in techniques related to sign language for helping deaf people.
